This repository contains code to establish communication with sensors with industry-standard protocols such as OPC-UA and others. Here, two machines are acting as the transmitter and the receiver respectively.
One VM acts as a sensor which is continuously sending data and the other is receiving data. Noise has also been added for realism.
