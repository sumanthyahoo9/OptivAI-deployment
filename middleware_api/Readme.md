Message Flow:

Publish: Data from protocol bridges goes into appropriate queues
Process: Workers pick up messages based on priority
Retry: Failed messages retry with delays
Dead Letter: Permanently failed messages go to DLQ for analysis

The system handles all the complexity of message ordering, retries, and failure handling. Your protocol bridges just publish messages, and your storage/RL systems process them reliably.
